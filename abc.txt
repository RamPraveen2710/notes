### **üì¢ Context: Understanding Financial Interactions**
In the financial industry, investors, analysts, and corporate executives frequently engage in meetings and discussions about various stocks and market trends. These discussions, known as **interactions**, contain valuable insights into a participant's interests, investment decisions, and company evaluations.  

Each **interaction** consists of multiple attributes, including:  
- **Timestamp:** When the discussion took place.  
- **Participants:** The people involved in the meeting (e.g., Investors, Analysts, Corporate Executives).  
- **Subject & Notes:** The main topics discussed during the meeting.  
- **Stock Ticker Mentioned (if any):** Whether a specific company stock (e.g., "NVDA" for NVIDIA) was explicitly discussed.  

However, not all interactions explicitly mention a stock ticker. Some discussions are **indirectly related** to a stock without directly naming it. For example:  
- A discussion on **‚ÄúAI chips‚Äù** may still be relevant to NVIDIA (NVDA) since NVIDIA is a major AI chip manufacturer.  
- A discussion about the **‚Äúsemiconductor market‚Äù** might involve NVIDIA but not mention the company directly.  

### **üîç Objective: Find Relevant Interactions for a Given Stock (e.g., NVDA)**
Your task is to analyze a set of **meeting interactions** and determine **which ones are relevant to the given stock ticker (NVDA).**  

#### **üõ† How to Determine Relevance?**
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Explicit Mentions (High Confidence)**
   - If `TickerDiscussed = NVDA`, **this interaction is highly relevant** (confidence score ~1.0).  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Context-Based Relevance (Moderate Confidence)**
   - If NVDA is **not explicitly mentioned**, analyze the `Subject` and `Notes`.  
   - Look for **indirect references** (e.g., "AI chips," "GPUs," "semiconductors").  
   - If contextually relevant, assign a confidence score between **0.7 - 0.9**.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **General Tech Discussions (Low Confidence)**
   - If the discussion is about **tech industry trends** or **AI investments** without specific stock references, it may have **weak relevance** (confidence **0.3 - 0.6**).  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Irrelevant Interactions (Discard)**
   - If there is **no connection to NVDA**, discard the interaction (confidence **<0.3**).  

#### **‚è≥ Time-Based Context (Interaction Timeline)**
- If a **client (FirmwideID) previously discussed NVDA**, then **subsequent interactions within 30 days** may still be related‚Äîeven if NVDA is not mentioned.

The idea behind interaction timelines is to understand the sequence of meetings/events that a client (FirmwideId) has before and after showing interest in NVDA (or any other ticker).

üí° Example:
Step 1: A client reads about NVDA on August 15, 2024.

Step 2: The client has a meeting with a research analyst on August 18, 2024.

Step 3: The same client joins another meeting on September 5, 2024, but NVDA is not explicitly mentioned.

üëâ Question: Should the meetings on August 18 and September 5 be considered as NVDA-related?
üëâ Answer: If NVDA was discussed previously, there's a high probability that the client continued the discussion in later interactions, even if NVDA was not explicitly mentioned.

This is why we construct a timeline for each NVDA-interested client and analyze how interactions evolve over time.
