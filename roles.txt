Problem Statement:


Limitations of Rule based Approach :

*Rule-based approach rely on predefined weights and thresholds, which fail to adapt to new patterns and edge cases.

Why Machine learning Approach:

*Machine learning model automatically identify patterns and relationships between features based on the real data.
*They adapt to the data instead of relying on hardcoded rules, making them more robust to variations.
*ML models can weigh features dynamically, understanding how they interact.
*Machine learning generalizes well, meaning it can better handle interactions with partial matches or borderline probabilities.
*Machine learning assigns probabilities dynamically, capturing nuanced relationships and producing finer-grained predictions.



Feature Engineering:

Start time difference:

*Difference between start time of both interactions, a key factor in interaction similarity.

Overlap Matching Percentage:

*It indicates how much of one interaction’s schedule coincides with another interaction.

*Interactions with a high degree of time overlap are more likely to be duplicates, especially in scenarios where participants are shared.

*Time difference alone cannot capture the extent to which interactions coincide.

	Example: Two meetings starting 5 minutes apart may have minimal overlap (e.g., 10%) or complete overlap (e.g., 90%),
	 which significantly affects their duplication probability.

Participant Matching:

*What it measures: The proportion of participants in the new interaction that match with the participants in the old interaction.
*Why it’s needed: Helps determine how closely the new interaction resembles the old one in terms of attendees.
*Works well for detecting whether the new interaction is a continuation, repeat, or direct duplicate of the old interaction.
*Relative to the old interaction because the old interaction is treated as the reference or baseline.

Particpant Overlap:

* The ratio of matching participants relative to the union of participants across both interactions (total unique participants).


Why matching and overlap seperate:
*participant matching separately offers specific advantages and granularity that cannot be fully replaced by overlap. 
*Participant Matching measures the extent to which the old interaction is "covered" by the new interaction's attendees, using the old interaction as the reference.

Why Role matching :

* Some time the significance of duplication depends on the Role of Participant matching 
* Role matching ensures that high-weight roles are given priority when assessing similarity, instead of treating all participants equally.
* For example a meeting that matches high-weight roles (e.g., multiple board members) might indicate a strategic continuation.
